# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to TrueStream. Here's how the process works.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch from `main`.
3. Make your changes following the code style and guidelines below.
4. Verify your changes pass all checks.
5. Submit a pull request targeting `main`.

## Code Style

### Flutter / Dart

- Follow [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/effective-dart) guidelines and the settings in `analysis_options.yaml`.
- Use **Riverpod** for shared state. Never use `setState()` for state shared across widgets. Use `ConsumerWidget` / `ConsumerStatefulWidget` with providers.
- Body text uses Instrument Sans via `GoogleFonts.instrumentSans()`. Mono text (speeds, URLs, format codes) uses `Theme.of(context).textTheme.mono` (the `TrueStreamTextStyles` extension on `TextTheme` that provides IosevkaCharonMono).
- All colors must reference DESIGN.md tokens via `TrueStreamColors`. Never hardcode hex values.
- Use `const` constructors where possible. Avoid mutable state in widgets.
- Aim for 48x48 minimum touch targets for interactive elements.
- Add semantic labels (`Semantics` widget) for screen reader support.
- Use `flutter analyze` before committing — must pass with zero errors.

### Python

- Follow **PEP 8** formatting standards.
- Use the `YoutubeDL` class API from yt-dlp. Never call `subprocess.run()` with the yt-dlp binary.
- All blocking operations must run in `threading.Thread` with a cancel event.
- Use structured JSON for Flutter communication. No `print()` statements for machine-readable output.
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility. Each module in `engine/truestream_engine/` owns one concern.
- Use `set_paths()` to inject all binary paths. Never hardcode paths.
- Run `pytest engine/tests/ -v` before committing — all tests must pass.

## Commit Conventions

Use conventional commit format:

```
type: scope: description in present tense
```

Types: `init` (scaffold), `feat` (new feature/screen), `fix`, `chore` (config/deps), `docs`, `style` (formatting, no logic change), `refactor`, `test`, `perf`.

Scope is optional but recommended (e.g., task ID like `P4-003`).

**One logical change per commit.** Never bundle unrelated changes in a single commit. Each commit diff should be reviewable in under 2 minutes.

## Branch Strategy

- **main** — stable, always deployable.
- **feature branches** — branch from `main`, name by task (e.g. `feat/sponsorblock-settings`, `fix/cancel-race`).
- Squash merge into `main` when the PR is approved.

## Testing

Always run these before committing:

```bash
# Flutter static analysis
flutter analyze

# Flutter widget & unit tests
flutter test

# Python engine tests
pytest engine/tests/ -v
```

The CI pipeline in `.github/workflows/verify.yml` enforces all three on every push and PR.

### Testing conventions

- **Flutter tests**: Write widget tests for screens via `WidgetTester`. Mock providers using `ProviderScope` overrides. Place tests in `test/`.
- **Python tests**: Write pytest functions for each module in `engine/tests/test_<module>.py`. Use plain `assert` statements. One test class per module.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your branch is up to date with `main`.
2. Run the full test suite (`flutter analyze`, `flutter test`, `pytest engine/tests/ -v`).
3. Fill out the pull request template — include motivation, description, and verification steps.
4. Mark which platforms you tested on (Android / Windows / Linux).
5. A maintainer reviews your changes. Address feedback before merging.
6. Squash commits if requested by the reviewer.

## Architecture Rules

- **yt-dlp**: `YoutubeDL` class API only. Never `subprocess.run()` with yt-dlp binary.
- **Downloads**: Always in `threading.Thread` with a cancel event. Never block the main thread.
- **State**: Riverpod `ConsumerWidget`/`Notifier`/`AsyncNotifier`. Never `setState()` for shared state.
- **Fonts**: Body = `GoogleFonts.instrumentSans()`. Mono = `Theme.of(context).textTheme.mono` (IosevkaCharonMono). Never system fonts.
- **Colors**: Always from DESIGN.md tokens via `TrueStreamColors`. Never hex literals.
- **Config**: Never hardcode paths. All binary paths injected via `set_paths()`.
- **Format options**: Never use both `merge_output_format` and `remux_video` simultaneously in yt-dlp options.
- **Layout structure**: Screens go in `lib/features/<feature>/screens/`. Providers go in `lib/providers/`. Theme and engine bridge go in `lib/core/`.

## How to Add a New Screen

1. **Create the screen file:** `lib/features/<feature>/screens/<name>_screen.dart`.
   - Extend `ConsumerWidget` or `ConsumerStatefulWidget` (if you need local state like text controllers).
   - Use `SuperRef` pattern — accept `super.key` and pass to super.
2. **Add a provider (if needed):** `lib/providers/<name>_provider.dart`.
   - Extend `StateNotifier<State>` or `AsyncNotifier<State>` for shared state.
   - Expose the provider as a global `final`.
3. **Wire navigation:**
   - Use `Navigator.of(context).push(MaterialPageRoute(...))` for simple navigation.
   - For bottom-nav screens, add the route in `lib/features/shell/screens/app_shell.dart`.
4. **Update the app entry point (rare):**
   - If the screen is a top-level route (onboarding, standalone), add it in `lib/main.dart`.
5. **Add semantic labels** for accessibility.
6. **Write a widget test** in `test/` covering the screen's basic rendering and interactions.

## How to Add a New Python Module

1. **Create the module:** `engine/truestream_engine/<module>.py`.
   - Import from sibling modules where needed (e.g. `from truestream_engine.paths import ...`).
   - Keep one responsibility per module.
2. **Add tests:** `engine/tests/test_<module>.py`.
   - Write pytest functions with plain `assert` statements.
   - Cover normal cases, edge cases, and error paths.
3. **Wire into the IPC dispatch** in `engine/truestream_engine/__main__.py`:
   - Add an `elif method == "<namespace>/<action>"` branch that calls your function.
   - Return a JSON-serializable dict (include `"success": True/False` for error reporting).
4. **Update the public API** in `engine/truestream_engine/__init__.py` if the function should be accessible from the package level.
5. **Run tests:** `pytest engine/tests/ -v` and verify all pass.
